### Muggle Chat

#### Create,Join and Send messages in Chat Room and based on your interest

This project was made only for learning Hasura (GraphQL platform that helps org. build data-driven applications and APIs). I want check, how authentication flow works, media files can be handled and most importantly how role based permissions can be set up . What can be it pros/cons if we use it for client projects.
Plus, I want to give a try to Apollo client which acts most of similar like an interceptor of axios (that is used for intercepting and modifying requests and responses).
